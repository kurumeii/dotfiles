# Project Overview

This is a `chezmoi` project for managing dotfiles. It includes configurations for various tools like `nvim`, `zsh`, `bash`, `wezterm`, etc. The setup is intended to be cross-platform, as indicated by the presence of both `.sh` and `.ps1` bootstrap scripts and the use of `chezmoi` templates.

## Tech Stack

- `chezmoi` for dotfile management.
- `lua` for Neovim configuration.
- Shell scripts (`bash`, `zsh`, `powershell`).
- Configuration files in `toml`, `yaml`, `json`.
