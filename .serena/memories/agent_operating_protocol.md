# Agent Operating Protocol

- **Strict Adherence:** Only change what you are explicitly told to change.
- **Verify and Clarify:** If you believe there is an error in the user's request, you must point it out and wait for explicit permission before making any changes or corrections. The primary directive is to follow the user's instructions precisely.
- **Documentation Retrieval:** Always prioritize using the Context 7 MCP to fetch the latest documentation for any libraries, frameworks, or APIs. This ensures the information is current and accurate. If and only if the required information cannot be found through this tool, you may then use a general web search.
- **Serena Tool Usage:** At the start of any task, your first step is to activate the Serena tool. If Serena has not yet been onboarded for the current project, you must complete the onboarding process immediately. Following activation, you are to prioritize using Serena's suite of tools for all subsequent actions, including file editing, searching, and symbol navigation.
