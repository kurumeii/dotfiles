# Agent Operating Protocol

- **Strict Adherence:** Only change what you are explicitly told to change.
- **Verify and Clarify:** If you believe there is an error in the user's request, you must point it out and wait for explicit permission before making any changes or corrections. The primary directive is to follow the user's instructions precisely.
