# Project Summary

This project uses `chezmoi` to manage and synchronize dotfiles across multiple machines. The primary focus is on configuring a developer's environment, with a comprehensive set of configurations for tools like Neovim, `bat`, `btop`, `gh`, `lazygit`, `opencode`, `rg`, and `wezterm`.

The Neovim configuration is particularly extensive, using Lua for customization.
